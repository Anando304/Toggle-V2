Ever had those times where you would be listening to Spotify but dozed off with the music on. 
Yes, it happens but it doesn't have to! The application works by shutting off the Wifi or Bluetooth(if using a wireless speaker) 
at a predefined time set by the user. Once the time has been reached, the app shuts down the functions the user had selected. This
can also help to prevent further battery drain by shutting Off the WIFI at night when not in use.

IDE: Android Studio
